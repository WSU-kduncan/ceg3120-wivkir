Setup
- How to get an API token
  - To get an API token, you must download it from the remote service you will be interacting with.
- Where to put it to work with the code
  - It is good practice to keep the API token within an .env variable file and never publish that file. You can still use the token by referencing the file with a variable in your code.
- Dependencies
  - In order to run this bot you will need: python 3, discord.py, and python-dotenv.


Usage
- What commands you can type in your Discord server
  - If anyone types "Jeremead"(a reference to my D&D group in the server I added the bot to) anywhere in a message the bot will respond with a random quote from one of the player's characters.


Research
- You may have realized that it is lame that it only runs when you run the program.
- In the real world, things are "always on", not waiting for Bob to turn his PC on and make sure the program is running.
- Research some possible solutions that would solve this, and discuss why you think it would work.
